        <p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/what-are-macronutrients" target="_blank" rel=noopener>Macronutrients</a> are certain types of nutrients that your body needs in larger quantities. There are 3 macronutrients</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Protein</li>
            <li>Carbohydrates</li>
            <li>Fats</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Each macronutrient is essential for helping humans function, allowing us to run, jump, repair cells, and build new tissue. The foods that we eat are made up of these macronutrients in different quantities. Knowing the balance of what macronutrients you need when is important for proper <a href="pregame.html#pregame">preparation for competition</a>, and for <a href="postgame.html">proper recovery</a></p>
        <h3>Protein</h3>
        <p>Protein plays a critical role by building and repairing tissues, including muscles, making it especially important for athletes and those engaging in regular physical activity. Protein is made of amino acids, which are the building blocks for muscle growth, enzyme production, and immune function. Eating enough protein supports muscle recovery and helps prevent muscle loss during intense exercise. Foods that are a good source of protein include meat, fish, dairy, eggs, legumes, and plant-based proteins like tofu and quinoa. For athletes, getting enough protein  is essential for building muscle and preventing injuries.</p>
        
        <h3>Carbohydrates</h3>
        <p>Carbohydrates are the body’s main source of energy, especially during high-intensity exercise. They are broken down into glucose, which fuels muscles and provides the necessary energy to sustain physical activity. Complex carbohydrates include: </p>
        <ul>
        <li>Whole Grains</li>
        <li>Vegetables</li>
        <li>Legumes</li>
        </ul> 
        <p>Complex carbohydrates will provide a slow and steady release of energy, while simple carbohydrates, found in fruits and sugary foods, offer quick bursts of energy. For athletes, consuming sufficient carbohydrates before and after workouts is needed for glycogen replenishment, preventing fatigue, and maintaining proper energy levels during a lasting competition. As an athlete, you may have heard of 'carbo-loading' before a competition. Although this is largely ineffective when done in the days leading up to a competition, eating a carb balanced meal several hours before a competition can make that energy available throughout the competition.</p>
        
        <h3>Fats</h3>
        <p>Fats are a macronutrient that provide long-lasting energy and support lots of bodily functions, including hormone regulation, brain health, and the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. While often villanized, healthy fats—such as those found in avocados, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and fatty fish—are important for athletes as they provide a concentrated energy source, especially during endurance activities. Fats also help in maintaining cell structure and supporting recovery. A balanced intake of healthy fats creates sustained energy, reduced inflammation, and supports healthy recovery.</p>
        
        <h2> Hydration</h2>
        <p>Hydration is crucial for athletes because it directly impacts their performance, endurance, and health. Water helps regulate body temperature, transporting nutrients to muscles, and removing waste products. During intense physical activity, athletes lose lots of fluids through sweat, and without proper hydration, athletes can become dehydrated. Even mild dehydration can limit an athlete’s strength, speed, and coordination. This makes reaction times slower and reduces stamina. If dehydration gets worse, it can cause muscle cramps, dizziness, and heat-related illnesses like heat exhaustion or heat stroke, all of which can be dangerous for an athlete.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, maintaining proper hydration supports recovery after strenuous exercise. Water helps to repairing muscle tissues and replace lost electrolytes, which are essential for maintaining nerve function and muscle contractions. Athletes should not only hydrate during training or competition but also drink enough fluids before and after. For proper hydration, athletes shouldn't only consume water, they should drink  electrolyte rich fluids, which will contain proper amounts of sodium and potassium. For athletes, hydration is not just about feeling thirsty, its about overall athletic success and long term well-being.</p>
