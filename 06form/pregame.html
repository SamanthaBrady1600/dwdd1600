    <h1>Pre-Game</h1>
        <h2>Day Before Competition</h2>
        <p>The day before a competition, athletes should focus on eating whole, nutrient-dense foods to maintain their energy levels and avoid any digestive issues. Prioritizing complex carbohydrates like quinoa, brown rice, sweet potatoes, and whole grain pasta helps to replenish glycogen stores in the muscles, providing a steady source of energy for the upcoming event. Pairing these carbs with lean proteins such as grilled chicken, fish, or plant-based options like lentils and beans supports muscle recovery from training. Including varying colorful vegetables and fruits will provide essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that support <a href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/nutrition-and-immunity/" target="_blank" rel=noopener>immune function</a> and reduce inflammation that is caused from exercise and injury. Healthy fats, like those found in nuts, seeds, and avocados, can help balance the meal while promoting long-lasting energy. Avoid processed foods, excess sugars, and high-fat, greasy meals that can lead to sluggishness, discomfort, and feeling light-headed. Staying well-hydrated throughout the day with water and electrolyte-rich fluids is also critical to ensure optimal performance the next day. Whole, natural foods will keep athletes energized and prepared for competition</p>
        
        <h2 id="pregame">3-4 Hours Before Competition</h2>
        <p>In the 3-4 hours leading up to a competition, it’s important for athletes to focus on consuming a full balanced meal that provides sustained energy without causing any stomach discomfort. Its a good rule of thumb to avoid new or untested foods in the hours before a competition. A good pre-competition meal should include a combination of complex carbohydrates, lean protein, and a small amount of healthy fats. Carbohydrates, such as whole grains, sweet potatoes, or brown rice, help replenish glycogen stores and provide the primary source of energy needed during intense physical activity. Lean protein, like chicken, turkey, or plant-based alternatives like tofu, supports muscle function and repair. Including a small amount of healthy fats, such as avocado or olive oil, can help keep athletes feeling full without creating sluggishness. It’s also key to avoid foods high in fiber, grease, or excess sugar, as these can lead to gastrointestinal issues. Hydration should be prioritized, with athletes drinking plenty of water and electrolytes during this period will help them be well-hydrated by game time.

        <h2>Less Than 30 Minutes Before Competition</h2>
        <p>Within 30 minutes of competition, there are several different things athletes can do to help raise energy levels and prepare for competition. The nutrition in this time period is very individual, so it may take some experimenting to figure out what works best for you. During or directly following a warmup, athletes may want to consume a serving of simple carbohydrates to produce quick energy at the start of a competition. Foods like oranges, applesauce, or honey are some natural ways to quickly raise energy levels as a competition starts.  </p>
